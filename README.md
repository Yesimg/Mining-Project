# Mining Quality Prediction Using Machine & Deep Learning

This was a project from Coursera were I had been working in:

- Train Artificial Neural Network models to perform regression tasks
- Understand the theory and intuition behind regression models and train them in Scikit Learn
- Understand the difference between various regression models KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, adjusted R2.
